        * Request Body: `{"username": "", "password": "ABC@123", "email": "abcd@gmail.com", "phone": 8939847556}`
        * Expected Response: 400 Bad Request
        * Verification: Verify that the API returns an error and does not create a user.
2. **Test Case 4:** Create a new user with invalid data - empty password
        * Request Body: `{"username": "ABC", "password": "", "email": "abcd@gmail.com", "phone": 8939847556}`
        * Expected Response: 400 Bad Request
        * Verification: Verify that the API returns an error and does not create a user.
3. **Test Case 5:** Create a new user with invalid data - duplicate username
        * Request Body: `{"username": "ABC", "password": "ABC@123", "email": "abcd@gmail.com", "phone": 8939847556}`
        * Expected Response: 400 Bad Request (due to uniqueness constraint)
        * Verification: Verify that the API returns an error and does not create a user.
4. **Test Case 6:** Create a new user with invalid data - invalid phone number format
        * Request Body: `{"username": "ABC", "password": "ABC@123", "email": "abcd@gmail.com", "phone": "invalid-phone-number"}`
        * Expected Response: 400 Bad Request
        * Verification: Verify that the API returns an error and does not create a user.
